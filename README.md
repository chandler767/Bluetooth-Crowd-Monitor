This project uses the ESP32’s BLE to scan for advertising BLE devices and the ESP32’s WiFi to publish the mac address of the advertising devices to PubNub. Then it uses serverless PubNub Functions to keep a realtime count of the number of advertising devices and displays the count in a React Native app.

## What is PubNub?

PubNub’s primary product is a [realtime publish/subscribe messaging API](https://www.pubnub.com/products/realtime-messaging/) built on a [global Data Stream Network](https://www.pubnub.com/products/global-data-stream-network/). Messages sent with PubNub are delivered in under 0.25 seconds and PubNub supports over [70 SDKs](https://www.pubnub.com/docs). PubNub provides the secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure to power any realtime application.
